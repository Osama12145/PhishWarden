  # Abstract
Phishing attacks have become one of the most prominent attacks faced by internet users, governments, and service-providing organizations. In a phishing attack, the attacker(s) collects the clientâ€™s sensitive data (i.e., user account login details, credit/debit card numbers, etc.) by using spoofed emails or fake websites. 
Our project employs machine learning technology for detection of phishing URLs by extracting and analyzing various features of legitimate and phishing URLs. and  Natural Language Processing (NLP) to extract information from emails, organizing them into corpora. Using a feature-based approach, we analyze these corpora to determine whether the content exhibits characteristics indicative of phishing attempts. By leveraging NLP for semantic analysis, our system assesses language patterns, context, and structural elements within the emails. Features such as suspicious keywords, irregular sender behavior, and abnormal formatting are utilized to identify potential phishing threats. This focused approach allows for an efficient and accurate detection mechanism tailored to the nuances of email communications. Through the integration of NLP and feature-based analysis, our project aims to enhance the capability of distinguishing between legitimate and phishing emails, contributing to a more robust defense against cyber threats.
